# airbnb-clone-project

- Part of the [Alx proDev: Backend Program](https://www.alxafrica.com/programme/prodev-backend/)

**1. Project Overview**

The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. Provides a robusts and scalable foundation for mapping user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments.

**2. Project Goals**

- User Management: Implement a secure system for user integration, authentication, and profile management.
- Property Management - Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
- Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details. 
- Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record booking details. 
- Review System: Allow Users to leave reviews and listings for properties. 
- Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations. 

**3. Technology Stack**
- Django: For building RESTful API.
- Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- PostgreSQL: Relational database for data storage.
- GraphQL: Handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments. 
- Redis: Caching and session management. 
- Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment. 

**4. Team Roles**
- Backend Developer: Implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
- Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
- DevOps Engineer: Deployment, monitoring, and scaling of backend services.
- QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thorougly tested and meet quality standards.

**5. Database Design**

- Users
- properties
- Bookings
- Payments
- Reviews

**6. Feature Breakdown**

**User AUthentication:**
- Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}
- Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles. 

**Property Management:**
- Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
- Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings. 

**Booking System**
- Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}
- Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details. 

**Payment Processing**
- Endpoints: /payments/
- Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings. 

**Review System**
- Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}
- Features: Post and manage reviews for properties. 

**API Security**
- OpenAPI Standard: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to secure clarity and ease of integration.
- Django REST Framework: provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
- GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend. 

**7. CI/CD Pipeline**
- Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes. 

**8. Database Optimization**
- Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
- Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce ddatabase load and improve performance.
